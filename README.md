# SESO Coding Challenge: Log Sorting

<br>

## Edward Fuentes codingTest for SESO

### considerations
I tried to do both solutions but to be honest Although I know I have much more time to send the test
 I don't have enough time to finish the second part. (I still have a responsibility with my current job, my Team is doing overtime and I can't leave them alone. I look forward to your consideration.)

I really enjoyed doing this test, it's been a long time since I had a test where something was really required (data structures are not common in tests)

Very good technical test.
